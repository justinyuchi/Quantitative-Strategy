# Quantitative Strategy Repository

Welcome to the Quantitative Strategy Repository! This repository contains various quantitative strategies and their implementations, with a particular focus on mean-variance optimization and long-short equity strategies. This repository is currently a work in progress, and I am continuously updating it with deeper research and new strategies.

## Projects

### [Mean-Variance Optimization and Backtesting](./Portfolio_Optimization.ipynb)
This project involves the implementation of mean-variance optimization, a foundational concept in modern portfolio theory. It includes backtesting to evaluate the performance of the optimized portfolios over historical data.

### [Long-Short Strategy Research](./Strategy_Factors_Formation.ipynb)
This project explores long-short equity strategies, including the formation and backtesting of over 10 different strategies across historical data. Key aspects of this research include:
- **Factor Combination**: Mixing different signals for strategy formation to enhance performance and robustness.
- **Machine Learning/Deep Learning Methodology**: Incorporating advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques to develop and improve long-short strategies.
- **Signal Robustness Analysis**: Analyzing the robustness of signals, which may affect portfolio turnover.
- **Visualization**: Providing visualizations to illustrate the performance and characteristics of the strategies.

**Note:** Individual files for each strategy will be uploaded in the future to enhance clarity and organization.

Future updates will include deeper research into individual strategies and the addition of new strategies.

## About Me

I am a Master's student in Quantitative Finance with dual bachelor's degrees in Science and Business Administration. My academic focus includes artificial intelligence, statistics, and finance. This repository is part of my ongoing research into quantitative finance strategies.

## Disclaimer

This repository showcases how to conduct quantitative research. Due to the proprietary nature of the data used in these projects (e.g., CRSP, COMPUSTAT), I cannot provide most of the datasets. The focus is on demonstrating the methodologies and techniques applied in quantitative finance research.
